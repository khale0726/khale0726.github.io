            <h3>What is Node.js?</h3>
            <p>
                Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

                What makes node different than developing with more traditional server side languages?
            </h3>
            <p>
                While most of the existing server side frameworks use an synchronous architecture, Node.js use an <strong>asynchronous</strong> architecture that JavaScript can handle well. This means that the server <strong>reacts to events</strong> and send events (messages) to e.g. the database. This style of programming is very different than the synchronous style, and may be hard to use with other languages. An asynchronous style use asynchronous IO and can scale well.

            <h3>
                What is the concept of non blocking IO?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Non-blocking refers to code that doesn't block execution. One advantage of non-blocking, asynchronous operations is that you can maximize the usage of a single CPU as well as memory.
